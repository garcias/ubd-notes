# Unit design

## Results

### Established goals and standards

What goals will this design address? These are often standards, program learning objectives, personal objectives.

### Understanding

What are the big ideas? What misunderstandings are likely to arise?

### Essential questions

What provocative questions will foster inquiry and understanding?

### Knowledge and skills

What key knowledge and skills will students gain? What should they be able to do afterward?


## Evidence

### Performance expectations

What authetic tasks will demonstrate facets of understanding? What criteria can you apply consistently and meaningfully?

### Other evidence

What evidence will demonstrate achievement of specific outcomes? How will reflection and self assessment occur?


## Learning plan

How will the course:

- **Establish**: purpose and expectations?
- **Hold**: the students' interest?
- **Equip**: students to reach the outcomes
- **Adapt**: to diverse needs and abilities?
- **Organize**: activities and align with goals?

How will students:

- **Explore**: explore, experience, and experiment with ideas?
- **Evaluate**: their work and understanding?
- **Revise**: Rethink and revise change their minds?
- **Reflect**: identify changes to their understanding and role of experience?

## Identifying essential questions and unerstandings

### What are the topics and core ideas?

- { _ }
- { _ }

### Generate questions

What essential questions are raised by these ideas? What should students come to understand about each one?

- Why study { _ }? So what?
- What makes the study of { _ } universal?
- If the unit on { _ } is a story, what is the moral?
- What core idea is implied in the skill or process of { _ }?
- What larger concept, issue or problem underlies { _ }?
- What couldn't we do if we didn't understand { _ }?
- How is { _ } used and applied in current, practical situations?
- What is a practical insight about { _ }?
- What is the value of studying { _ }?

### Essential questions

- { _ }
- { _ }
- { _ }

### Understandings

- { _ }
- { _ }
- { _ }

### Check

Test that each understanding ...

1. is about a transferable core idea
2. is stated as a proposition
3. is stated as a specific and insightful generalization
4. is either topical or broad, but not both


# Assessment

## Designing performance tasks

### GRASPS

To generate an authentic performance task, address the *GRASPS* aspects of a task.

- **Goal:** task, problem, or desired outcome
- **Role:** job, request, contract
- **Audience:** clients, stakeholders, supervisors
- **Situation:** context, constraints, backstory, challenge
- **Product:** create, develop
- **Standards:** criteria for success, benchmarks, outcomes

### Check

**Frame.**      Problem statement is clear, but offers no clues to relevant principles or skills.

**Approach.**   Strategy is required, but multiple are possible and the appropriate ones are not obvious.

**Setting.**    Noisy with multiple factors, constraints, and data to consider

**Solution.**   Requires support and argument to be believed.

**Evidence.**   Plausibility and justification of approach matter.



# UbD Assessment builder by facet

What aspects of the unit or course reveal the following abilities of a student who understands the subject?

## Explain

- **Account for observations**. Provide complex, insightful, and credible reasons for an event, fact, text, or idea; connecting theories, principles, and models to evidence and logic as part of a systematic account.
- **Avoid misunderstandings**. Make fine, subtle distinctions in order to map their knowledge and methods to a situation precisely.
- **Recognize significance**. See central ideas, key questions, and decisive evidence; and justify their account using sound arguments.

## Interpret

- **Translate materials**. "Read between the lines" and offer possible meanings behind artifacts and discourse
- **Offer context**. Recognize the implications of scholarship that are specific to a context

## Apply

- **Employ knowledge**. Map principles and background to a situation.
- **Innovate**. Adjust approach and methods as information arises

## Perspective

- **Critique**. Present a position as a point of view justified by premises and rationale. Contrast the arguments for and against an assertion. Consider a perspective fully.
- **Acknowledge uncertainty**. Recognize the limits of an idea, method, or argument.
- **Detect bias**. Recognize potential bias and its source. Infer the assumptions underlying an idea and interests that motivate it.

## Empathize

- **Anticipate others**. Anticipate the responses of others to an action or idea, respond to concerns, and seek their insight.
- **Collaborate**. Ensure participation in discourse, acknowledge others' contributions, recognize heterogeneous abilities and insights
- **Embrace others**. Accept unfamiliar insights or methods, find plausibility in flawed accounts, identify value of diverse thought.

## Reflect
- **Recognize personal limits**. Consider personal bias and assumptions, predict effects of personal projections, separate personal beliefs from those of others.
- **Investigate**. Identify specific knowledge to be acquired and generate questions to guide further inquiry
- **Acknowledge change**. Narrate trajectory of understanding and change mind.
