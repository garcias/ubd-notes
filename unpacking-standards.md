# Unpacking standards

## Critique of standards

The authors present some examples of state standards, pointing out that they often contain too many discrete items, encompass too broad a scope, or are simply too general to be distinguished from learning overall.

Despite these failings, standards often contain the elements of UbD components, including key ideas, performance indicators, and sample tasks. Thus they hint at the type of evidence that might be sought in assessing learning. 

The authors therefore recommend unpacking these components. One strategy is to monitor recurring nouns, adjectives, and verbs to identify for broad, transferable ideas and specific performance expectations; and translate these into essential questions, core ideas, and performance tasks.

For geography:

> Analyze regional development of Asia, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, in terms of physical, economic, cultural characteristics, and historical evolution since 1000 C.E.

For social studies:

> 1. Compare present with past, evaluating consequences of past events and determining lessons learned.
> 2. Analyze how change happens at different rates over time; understand that some aspects can change while others do not.
> 3. Use a variety of maps and documents to interpret human movement, including settlement patterns, technological innovations, ...

For science:

> The purpose of science is to develop explanations of natural phenomena in a continuing creative process:
> - formulate questions, with aid of appropriate references, in searching to explain everyday observations
> - construct explanations for natural phenomena by proposing visual models
> - represent and defend explanations in a comprehensible way for assessment
>
> For example, when shown disparity between recyclable content and actual recycling, explain by developing possible theories and selecting one; refining it for further assessment; rated on clarity, plausibility, and suitability for research and further study.


## Mathematics example

As an example, the authors take a convoluted mathematical modeling standard from New Jersey:

> All students will connect mathematics to other learning by understanding the interrelationships of mathematical ideas and the roles that mathematics and mathematical modeling play in other disciplines and in life.

From the nouns and adjectives, they infer the big idea:

- mathematical modeling applies to various disciplines and life

From the verbs the infer some performance indicators:

- give examples of modeling applied to real-life data or phenomena
- review a mathematical model for appropriateness to a situation

They translate these insights to essential questions, core ideas, and performance tasks:

- What is the pattern in a phenomenon or situation?
- How do we know if a model is appropriate for a situation?

- Models help us to simply and analyze a situation in terms of a relationship.
- Models help to explain patterns.
- A model can mislead one's thinking, so we evaluate its appropriateness.

- Have students construct a mathematical model for a given problem, such as seasonal temperature data, that are consistent with multiple plausible relationships.
- Review a proposed model for appropriateness to a given situation, e.g. Mercator Projection for spatial information.


## Science example

To test my understanding of the process, I decided to apply it to the science example.

### Goal

> The purpose of science is to develop explanations of natural phenomena in a continuing creative process:
> - formulate questions, with aid of appropriate references, in searching to explain everyday observations
> - construct explanations for natural phenomena by proposing visual models
> - represent and defend explanations in a comprehensible way for assessment
>
> For example, when shown disparity between recyclable content and actual recycling, explain by developing possible theories and selecting one; refining it for further assessment; rated on clarity, plausibility, and suitability for research and further study.

**Nouns:** natural phenomena, explanations, creative process, questions, appropriate references, visual models, everyday explanations.

**Adjectives:** plausible, suitable, comprehensible, appropriate

**Verbs:** develop, formulate, explain, construct, proposing, represent, defend, refine

### Core ideas and essential questions

- scientific process produces explanations of observed, natural phenomena
- scientists generate and improve explanations through reasoned discourse

- What makes an explanation appropriate and plausible?
- How do we generate plausible explanations given observations?
- How do scientists respond to an implausible explanation?
- How do we taest whether an appropriate explanation is actually true?

### Performance indicators

- Formulate questions for testing an explanation
- Propose explanations that address observations
- Assess plausbility and relevance of a given explanation

Task: Given a country's recycling data, broken out by material type and recycling process, propose three possible theories to explain the discrepancy. Assess the plausibility of each one and select the best two. For each one, cite a possible reason it would not be correct, and describe the information needed to discriminate the two theories. Write instructions for searching for this information.


## Qualities of a big idea

The authors point out some attributes of "big ideas":

- broad application across subjects
- abstractions
- represented by just a few words
- timeless
- represented by examples with common attributes

They assert that such ideas provide a focusing lens for studying a particular topic, and provide the thread connecting detailed facts and skills. They can expose the difference between expert and novice abilities, often in the form of a common misunderstanding. They should transfer across subjects and over time.


## Provocative idea of UbD

UbD actively embraces a core idea that is so unintuitive to many people: that thorough, deep undestanding of a discipline's representative ideas *is equivalent to* knowing the entire discipline, because it promotes comprehension of patterns, speeds acquisition of other elements, and generates new knowledge for the discipline.


## Methods of generating big ideas

1. Identify abstract ideas in general educational standards and goals.
2. Identify recurring nouns and verbs in standards documents.
3. Refer and reuse common transferrable concepts, e.g., equilibrium, interactions, patterns, perspective.
4. Ask generative questions about a topic, e.g., What makes {...} universal? How is the concept of {...} used in practice?
5. Express distinctions, e.g. absorb vs reflect, continuity vs change, nation vs people, meaning vs syntax.

### Enliven core ideas with:

- potential misunderstandings
- paradoxes
- counterintuitive examples
- difficulty of proving something

### Link core ideas with skills

For example, 

- To persuade, a writer must understand persuasion itself and why some techniques are effective in some situations rather than others.
- To create an appropriate model, one must understand what makes it valid and applicable, and the potential ways models can mislead.

### Use common types of questions for stimulating inquiry

- Why study {{topic}}? Why does it matter?
- What makes studying {{topic}} universally relevant?
- What is the moral of the narrative about {{topic}}?
- What core idea is implied by the process of {{topic}}?
- What larger problems underly {{topic}}?
- What would happen if we didn't understand {{topic}}?
- How do others use and apply {{topic}}?

### Use suggestive pairs to generate ideas

- absorb and reflect
- action and reaction
- capital and labor
- constant and variable
- continuity and change
- factor and result
- fate and freedom
- light and shadow
- like and unlike
- literal and figurative
- matter and energy
- power and governance
- sign and signified
- structure and function
- sum and difference


### Look to common transferable concepts

For example, the NGSS defines "cross-cutting concepts" that students should encounter and recognize across disciplines and grade levels.

Within discourse on pedagogy, many transferable concepts have been identified, such as:

- competition for resources
- adaptation to change
- aging and maturity
- balance and tradeoffs
- change vs continuity
- community
- compassion
- conflict
- consistency
- cooperation
- correlation
- courage
- cycles
- defense vs exploration
- democracy
- dignity
- discovery and invention
- environment
- equilibrium
- evolution
- fairness
- friendship
- harmony
- honor and loyalty
- interactions
- interdependence
- justice and liberty
- migration
- mood
- order
- patterns
- perspective
- productivity
- quality vs quantity
- proof and refutation
- rhythm
- survival
- symbol
- system
- technology
- variability
