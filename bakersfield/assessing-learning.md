# Student learning outcomes

Student learning outcomes (SLOs) describe specific, measurable goals expected of learning. They may involve knowledge, skills, or behavior. (Bakersfield college)

## Qualities of student learning outcomes

- Focus on what the student can do, using active verbs.
- Articulate criteria that define the expected level of competency.
- Share the outcomes with faculty from other disciplines and within your own discipline. Their requests for clarification will help focus the meaning of the statements, and suggest criteria.
- Share the outcomes with your students. Their requests for clarification will reveal discipline-specific or pedagogical language that they may not understand.

## Example with a nutrition course

### Goal

The goal of this nutrition course is to prioritize key nutrition behaviors, identify health and nutrition needs, and integrate these behaviors into health interventions, educational training, and policy.

### Course Objectives

- Review nutritional recommendations and components.
- Discuss differences in nutritional requirements associated with sex, age, and activity.
- Describe causes and consequences of nutritional problems.
- Explain complications of underlying physiologic conditions (e.g.  diabetes & mal-absorption).
- Identify key factors involved in correcting nutritional behaviors.
- Describe resources and strategies to treat nutritional disorders.

### Student learning outcome

A student will analyze a documented nutritional problem, determine a strategy to correct the problem, and write a draft nutritional policy addressing the broader scope of the problem.

## Writing SLOs

1. Answer the following questions:
    - Are there prerequisites for this course?
    - Is this course a prerequisite for others?
    - What is the purpose of the course?
2. Think about the 5-7 most important things a student should leave your class being able to do.
3. Write down words that express knowledge, skills, or values that integrate the most important aspects of your class.
4. Use domain-chart verbs to express these expectations as measurable outcomes.
5. Check whether each outcome:
    - suggests an assessment task
    - address the level of competency expected
    - has universal values
    - consistent with syllabus and program goals
    - will make sense to the student
