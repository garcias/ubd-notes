# Understanding understanding

At the simplest level, the authors distinguish between between knowledge and understanding through a visual analogy. Facts and information are like white and black tiles arranged in a pattern. To understand is to *infer* the meaning of the pattern, to create awareness beyond the information given, and the judgment to discriminate between what is relevant and what is incidental.

The authors illustrate this idea with a nonacademic example: the concept of "constraining offensive space" in a team sport. It applies to any position or player on the field, and in full games or 3-on-3 drills.

For a more prosaic example, they offer that reading one group and exploring questions about it should make the next book easier to comprehend and more meaningful.


## Evidence of understanding

The authors assert that the quest for understanding should uncover:

- potential misunderstandings
- questions, premises, controversy beneath surface accounts
- core, provocative, non-intuititive ideas

They warn of assessment that is prone to *apparent* understanding. When the prompt changes, there should still be a meaningful, coherent response, not a prepared response or just confusion. 

They emphasize that understanding implies the ability to generalize knowledge or skill and transfer it to a new situation. Gaining this ability is more than drill and practice, but also an examination of that knowledge in the first place: How did it come to be known? What is the evidence and argument for it? What does it assume? Understanding knowledge is to know what *makes* it so.

Thus they suggest that evidence of understanding should be in response to novel situations or new elements. They cited some examples to illustrate this point.

- Design and revise an experiment to determine chemical content of a material.
- Write a credible narrative about a specific historical period consistent with a set of accounts and facts.



## Misunderstanding

Misunderstanding is not ignorance, but rather "inappropriate mapping of an idea to a situation, often by not recognizing relationships." Contrary to popular opinion, any kind of testing can detect misunderstanding, if designed around the misunderstanding. Much of human thought is driven by predictable misunderstandings. For example:

- Physics education has developed the force concept inventory on the basis of common misunderstandings about mechanics
- Math educators constantly struggle against the notion that a symbol in algebra have a special meaning, when its selection is in fact arbitrary.
- Similarly, students construe the "=" sign as a signal to calculate, rather than expressing equivalence and the action of unitization.
- Students often fail to use a mean or median to *represent* a property.
- Classic misunderstandings in astronomy, even among college science students, are in explaining the origin of seasons on Earth or the phases of the moon.
- Biology teachers try to eradicate students' intuitive Lamarckism, only to find them combining Lamarckian intuitions with Darwinist concepts. 

The authors note that the AAAS's *Benchmarks* (1993) and *Atlas of Science Literacy* (2001) provide an accounting of desired understandings in science and misunderstandings to avoid. 

Misunderstandings are helpful in that they invite the question: "How did you draw that conclusion?" which in turn exposes the (inappropriate) transfer of knowledge. Addressing the misunderstanding allows the student to continue transferring knowledge, only now looking for the criteria of appropriateness. 

The authors catalog some broad misunderstandings, some of them about learing itself:

- Impressionism involves the artist's *impression* of a subject.
- The moon is not visible during the new-moon phase because the Earth eclipses it.
- The goal of scientific experimentation is to prove causes.
- History is a listing of facts.
- If you cup your hands when swimming, you will catch water and move faster.
- Light is presence of light and dark is absence of light.
- Real numbers are more representative than imaginary numbers.
- The evolution of species is a controversial assertion.
- Literary irony is just a coincidence.
