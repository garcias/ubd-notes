# Understanding

The authors assert that the quest for understanding should uncover:

- potential misunderstandings
- questions, premises, controversy benath surface accounts
- core, provocative, non-intuititive ideas

They suggest that evidence of understanding should be in response to novel situations or new elements. They cited some examples to illustrate this point.

- Design and revise an experiment to determine chemical content of a material.
- Write a credible narrative about a specific historical period consistent with a set of accounts and facts.

They warn of assessment that is prone to *apparent* understanding. When the prompt changes, there should still be a meaningful, coherent response, not a prepared response or just confusion.

## Misunderstanding

Misunderstanding is not ignorance, but rather "inappropriate mapping of an idea to a situation, often by not recognizing relationships." Contrary to popular opinion, any kind of testing can detect misunderstanding, if designed around the misunderstanding. Much of human thought is driven by predictable misunderstandings. For example:

- Physics education has developed the force concept inventory on the basis of common misunderstandings about mechanics
- Math educators constantly struggle against the notion that a symbol in algebra have a special meaning, when its selection is in fact arbitrary.
- Similarly, students construe the "=" sign as a signal to calculate, rather than expressing equivalence and the action of unitization.
