## Theory of understanding

We instinctively treat understanding as a state of mind (noun), but when pressed to explicate it further, we describe what this state of mind allows one to do (verbs): use, prove, teach, explain, defend, connect, contrast, demonstrate. The authors hold that we have six different types of expectations for someone who understands something; we explect them to:

**Explain**. Identify the principles underlying predictions; account for observations, generate hypotheses, and connect related phenomena.

**Interpret.** Translate meaning, create a narrative around observations, make an idea accessible through metaphor, reveal an overlooked personal or cultural dimension.

**Apply.** Adapt knowledge for a novel problem, create a response to a stimulus.

**Take Perspective.** Model alternative access to information and knowledge.

**Empathize.** Find value in one's experience, model alternative response, embrace and accept the other's experiences and ideas.

**Reflect.** Have awareness of knowledge, perceive biases that shape current understanding, identify lack of undertanding, reflect on meaning.

The process of creating understanding involves several activities: creating, generalizing, modeling, seeking alternatives, expressing, organizing, making the implicit explicit, and recombining.

To prove understanding, students perform **transfer tasks** with the following qualities:

- related to actual performance demands
- are authentic
- represent challenges of the subject
- are unfamiliar and unrehearsed, lacking cues
- requires adaptation of knowledge to a new situation
- identifies additional problems
- must distinguish students with knowledge and skill but not undertanding

# Backward design

The authors describe three stages of backward design:

1. Identify desired results
2. Determine acceptable evidence of understanding
3. Plan learning experience to produce understanding

The authors propose a design template for planning and monitoring the process of backward design. This (non popular) template articulates the elements of a design that need to be determined and specified.
