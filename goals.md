# Goals

The first stage of design is to establish goals based on understanding but relevant to external demands.


# Understanding understanding

The authors explore a few different ways to describe understanding, focusing on expectations we have of someone with understanding:

- **Meaningful inferences.** A person should pick out patterns from indiviudal facts, infer underlying relationships, and recognize possible implications.
- **Transferability.** A person should map the features of one situation to another one, and thus apply relationships and practices appropriately.
- **State of mind.** A person's understanding should change their abilities and habits long-term.

At the simplest level, the authors distinguish between between knowledge and understanding through a visual analogy. Facts and information are like white and black tiles arranged in a pattern. To understand is to *infer* the meaning of the pattern, to create awareness beyond the information given, and the judgment to discriminate between what is relevant and what is incidental.

The authors illustrate this idea with a nonacademic example: the concept of "constraining offensive space" in a team sport. It applies to any position or player on the field, and in full games or 3-on-3 drills.

For a more prosaic example, they offer that reading one book and exploring questions about it should make the next book easier to comprehend and more meaningful.


## Evidence of understanding

The authors assert that the quest for understanding should uncover:

- potential misunderstandings
- questions, premises, controversy beneath surface accounts
- core, provocative, non-intuititive ideas

They warn of assessment that is prone to *apparent* understanding. When the prompt changes, there should still be a meaningful, coherent response, not a prepared response or just confusion. 

They emphasize that understanding implies the ability to generalize knowledge or skill and transfer it to a new situation. Gaining this ability is more than drill and practice, but also an examination of that knowledge in the first place: How did it come to be known? What is the evidence and argument for it? What does it assume? Understanding knowledge is to know what *makes* it so.

Thus they suggest that evidence of understanding should be in response to novel situations or new elements. They cited some examples to illustrate this point.

- Design and revise an experiment to determine chemical content of a material.
- Write a credible narrative about a specific historical period consistent with a set of accounts and facts.



## Misunderstanding

Misunderstanding is not ignorance, but rather "inappropriate mapping of an idea to a situation, often by not recognizing relationships." Contrary to popular opinion, any kind of testing can detect misunderstanding, if designed around the misunderstanding. Much of human thought is driven by predictable misunderstandings. For example:

- Physics education has developed the force concept inventory on the basis of common misunderstandings about mechanics
- Math educators constantly struggle against the notion that a symbol in algebra have a special meaning, when its selection is in fact arbitrary.
- Similarly, students construe the "=" sign as a signal to calculate, rather than expressing equivalence and the action of unitization.
- Students often fail to use a mean or median to *represent* a property.
- Classic misunderstandings in astronomy, even among college science students, are in explaining the origin of seasons on Earth or the phases of the moon.
- Biology teachers try to eradicate students' intuitive Lamarckism, only to find them combining Lamarckian intuitions with Darwinist concepts. 

The authors note that the AAAS's *Benchmarks* (1993) and *Atlas of Science Literacy* (2001) provide an accounting of desired understandings in science and misunderstandings to avoid. 

Misunderstandings are helpful in that they invite the question: "How did you draw that conclusion?" which in turn exposes the (inappropriate) transfer of knowledge. Addressing the misunderstanding allows the student to continue transferring knowledge, only now looking for the criteria of appropriateness. 

The authors catalog some broad misunderstandings, some of them about learing itself:

- Impressionism involves the artist's *impression* of a subject.
- The moon is not visible during the new-moon phase because the Earth eclipses it.
- The goal of scientific experimentation is to prove causes.
- History is a listing of facts.
- If you cup your hands when swimming, you will catch water and move faster.
- Light is presence of light and dark is absence of light.
- Real numbers are more representative than imaginary numbers.
- The evolution of species is a controversial assertion.
- Literary irony is just a coincidence.


# Essential questions

According to the authors, the purpose of essential questions is to focus the mind on general, abstract big ideas even while it is wading through specific content. Essential questions help the student to "interrogate" the content, which should in turn deepen their understanding. They describe essential questions as inviting dispute, lacking concise final answers, and leading the student to confrong misunderstandings. Quoting Bruner (1996), they describe questions that "pose dilemmas, subvert obvious truths, or force incongruities upon our attention". They often elicit alternative views and expose the reasoning used to arrive at and justify our answers.

The authors caution that essential questions need not be very global. To be essential to a given discipline, they need to be able to *define* that discipline. At the same time, a question should offer transferability across disciplines; it should be able to define another discipline in combination with a different set of essential questions. Finally, an essential question should be an authentic one, one that practitioners of a discipline use in their inquiry.

## Connotations of "Essential"

These questions are essential in four senses:

- They recur throughout one's life, though in different forms.
- They involve on core ideas in a subject, which may be why they recur.
- They naturally lead the student to specific content necessary to understand the core ideas.
- They must be relevant to the learners in question.

(To the last point, the authors point out that desired results may need translation to "kid-friendly" language.)

The authors recommend taking six criteria for assessing whether a question is essential:

1. Stimulates genuine and relevant inquiry into core ideas and content.
2. Provokes careful thought and discussion.
3. Leads to new understanding and further questions.
4. Requires students to consider alternatives, weigh evidence, and support their conclusions.
5. Prompts rethinking of core ideas, assumptions, and misunderstandings.
6. The question naturally recurs throughout life and my transfer to other situations.

Draws attention to definitions.

Most importantly, an essential question signals the understanding-related goals of the unit or course.

## Essential questions for skills

The authors note that skill-intensive subjects, such as art, athletics, and experimental methods, can still be defined by essential questions. 

- **Reading.** How can you know that you truly comprehend what you are reading? How necessary is prior knowledge to comprehension?
- **Laboratory science.** How do we know if a procedure has been implemented correctly? 

The NGSS *Scientific & Engineering Practices* may provide some starting points for generating skill-based essential questions.


## Scope of essential questions

In unit-level design, there will be an urge to think of essential questions in the context of a specific topic. The authors feel that if a question can be settled by the end of a unit, it is not truly essential. But they point out that topical essential questions can point toward more general ones. For examples:

- What do ceremonial masks reveal about Inca culture? => *How does art reflect and shape culture?*
- What are possible sources of error in this experiment? => *How do we distinguish inherent error from avoidable error in science?*
- What are the possible false-positive results in this study? => *How can we detect and correct for bias in investigations?*
- Why did the Roman Empire collapse? => *What factors play a role in the accumulation of power?*

## Typology of essential questions

The authors suggest classifying essential questions along two dimensions: **intent** (to generate vs to direct) and **scope** (general vs topical). They assert that topical questions are necessary for unit thinking but not sufficient to yield transfer and connection. They recommend explicitly matching topical questions with their general counterparts. 

- **Generative and general.** To what extent is U.S. history one of progress?
- **Generative and topical.** How might Congress have better protected minority rights?
- **Focusing and general.** How much progress in civil rights has the U.S. made?
- **Focusing and topical.** What were defining moments of the civil-rights movement?

## Generating essential questions

The authors suggest a "Jeopardy"-based strategy: take an assertion and then infer the question that leads to it. Then 

**Example.** For the concept "three branches of government", we can generate the following topical questions:

- Why do we need a balance of powers? What is the alternative?
- What problems were Founders trying to solve with their proposals?
- Why did Federalists advocate for balance of power? What were the objections?

From these questions, we can suggest more broader questions with less definitive answers:

- What government should we expect if we make certain assumptions about human nature?
- When is it wise to share power? What do we gain and lose by dividing it?

The authors also suggest starting with declarative standards:

- "All students will apply their understanding of cells to the functioning of multi-cellular organisms, including how cells grow, develop, and reproduce." => *How can we prove that cells make up living things? If we are all made of cells, why don't we all look alike?* => **How do scientists prove anything about entities they can't see or touch?**
- "Understand dance as a way to create and communicate meaning." => *What ideas can we express through dance? How can stylized motion convey emotion?* => **How do artists express what they think and feel? How does a medium influence a message?**

The authors recommend thinking about facets of understanding to help with generating essential questions that lead to understanding and evidence of understanding. They offer a tool for generating appropriate language appropriate for these facets.

## Using essential questions

Since the purpose of essential questions is to elicit curiosity and then guide inquiry into content, they can guide unit and lesson design:

- Select and frame content as answering essential questions.
- Link assessment tasks to the questions, specifying how responses to questions might look.
- Scope questions such that you only need 2 to 5 per unit.
- Expect students to embrace and use the essential questions themselves, and encourage them to personalize the questions.
- Share broader questions with other instructors so that they can reinforce them.

The authors finish with an impassioned plea for instructors to prioritize essential questions in thinking about and doing their work. The authors encourage us to favor questions that highlight contested ideas and the provisional nature of claims. Doing so invites students to participate in the process of recognizing, proposing, testing, and solidifying understandings. In fact, they suggest that essential questions should serve as the *criteria* against which we judge progress in learning. Ideally we would ask if an educational activity is helping students to answer and explore the essential questions.

# Crafting understandings

An "understanding":

- expresses an inference drawn from shared and discussed experience
- *is* a complete proposition (rather than just referring to an idea)
- pertains to general ideas that transfer across disciplines
- involves counterintuitive and easily misunderstood ideas
- hints at the outlines of a historical dispute
- cannot be grasped immediately, but only by exploring its dimensions
- expresses multiple concepts in relation to each other
- provides strategic principles for applying skills


## Features of an understanding

### Understanding as transferable inference

An understanding should express a general inference drawn from the experience of many people and communities. Over time, those who have studied power and liberty have come to understand that various social movements have pioneer and refine different mechanisms to limit the power of government and of individuals. 

### Understanding as constructed

An understanding is hard earned through the process of proposing, testing, and revising ideas. The experts who bequeath us knowledge did not take it on faith, but rather had to construct it and contest it until communities of inquiry could agree on a common expression.

### Understanding as counterintuitive

An understanding is prone to dispute because it involves a counterintuitive idea prone to misunderstanding. Participants have to be careful in expressing the idea, often defining the terms and conditions precisely to ensure they are thinking about the same thing. Gravity is so tricky because it's so easy to confuse speed with acceleration, and to apply relationships inappropriately to different situations. For example, an object's mass affects its gravitational force but not the observed acceleration.

### Understanding as strategy

An understanding requires skill before you can grasp it and transfer it. Thus an understanding should highlight or at least hint at strategic principles for applying skills to solving a problem. Close reading is necessary to finding meaning in a text. Vectorial addition is needed to understand how celestial mechanics are perceived by a geocentric observer.

## Issues in crafting understandings

### Developmental issues

The authors acknowledge that for young learners, the distinction between fact and understanding can be gray, since:

> What is initially a difficult inference can become, over time, an accepted and "obvious" fact.

This is a form of the Expert Blind Spot. As experts, we recognize that the value of expressng a hard-won understanding is that we no longer have to clarify, test, and refine it. It is too tempting to assert our understanding by asking the learner to accept and commit the understanding for recall. 

This risk implies that we need to stop and consider the student: will the desired understanding tread new ground for them? One way to remain adaptive is to offer initial and ongoing checks for misconceptions. A key step is to admit and recall one's own "former views and struggles" for understanding, which experts tend to forget or resist. Another helpful step is to *introduce vocabulary only when it is necessary to clarify ideas and discussion*.

### Misunderstandings

Students are inherently comfortable with old misunderstandings, so it is not effective to simply introduce contradictory ones on the side and hope they displace the old ones. Instead, the misunderstandings must be identified and their flaws explored and acknowledged. To learn a proper golf swing, first unlearn the intuitive but naïve golf swing a learner assumes must be best.

### Contested areas of study

For some subjects, there is no consensus undestanding. In this case, the contention itself is the understanding. A good example are the causes of the Civil War. The issues, methods, and analyses are still important ideas and there are still essential questions.

## Examples

### Pythagorean theorem example

The authors consider the Pythagorean theorem to illustrate the nature of an understanding. They point out that the theorem statement itself is simple but non-obvious, and hides a plethora of connected ideas and inferences.

- The theorem holds true for any right triangle, regardless of size or shape.
- The claim can be proven true for all triangles.
- The proof essentially enables all of trigonometry, comparison of arbitrary shapes, and the measurement of distance in multiple dimensions.
- We cannot prove it by inspection, but by logical argument (whether graphical or verbal).
- The claim is deduced from axioms and logic, not observed empirically.

### Golf course example

The authors present an example of writing understandings for unit design:

> - Toital force equals the sum of force each body segment produces if the forces are applied in a single direction with specific sequence and timing.
> - When all forces are applied sequentially in the same direction and with proper timing, maximum force is achieved.
> - Muscular contractions and create, resist, and stop force.
> - Internal force production dpeends on the number and size of muscles, stretch reflex, and distance and speed of contraction.
> - A muscle generates maximum force by contracting through its full range of motion.
> - Follow-through allows for greater momentum on release, because deceleration can occur after release.

The authors warn that while these statements are informative for unit design, they probably won't make sense to novices and shouldn't be part of instruction.

- Writing from another person's perspective can help you better understand yourself, others, and the world you live in.
- Photographs reflect a point of view and can mislead as much as reveal.
 

# Facets of understanding

Wiggins and McTighe describe six aspects of understanding in terms of how understanding is manifested in student behavior.

## Characteristic attributes

The facets seem to be distinguished by three attributes, which provide a rubric for organizing and comparing them: 

- locus of awareness: **personal** vs **impersonal**
- scope of attention: **goal-oriented** vs **context-oriented**
- scope of composition: **eliminative** vs **generative**

Four facets are *impersonal* in that the student's thinking is about things outside of their mind, and are probably the most identifiably academic. Of them, **Explanation** and **Application** are *goal-oriented*, where the outcome of thinking achieves a purpose. Explanation involves matching observations, events, and other evidence against a single explanatory account, often *eliminating* inconsistent hypotheses along the way. Application, in contrast, involves invoking theory in responding to constraints, to generate one or more possible solutions to a problem.

**Speculation** and **Interpretation** are *context-oriented*, where thinking is embedded in the context of a situation. Speculation involves perspective taking, trying to hypothesize how an actor's perspective affects the significance of a given event or fact; it is *eliminative* in the sense that it applies constraints based on what is known or expected. Interpretation, in contrast, involves *generating* alternative stories based on what is *not* known, and strives to expand notions of what is possible.

The other two facets are *personal* in that student's thinking is about their own mind and how it changes. **Empaty** involves acquiring the affective response of another person to a given situation, and fundamentally accepting other people (their minds, their experiences, their aims) into a discourse. **Metacognition** involves self awareness of current, established patterns of thought and their limits.


## Explanation

Explanation accounts for specific events, phenomena, and observations using generalized models, theories, and abstractions. When a student engages in explanation, they address the "why and how", and answer questions like:

- Why did an event happen?
- How can we prove a relationship?
- What does our account imply?

### Examples

- Myriad cake recipes are based on a small set of formulas
- We infer the cause of a set of unexpected sounds and motions
- Mustard emulsifies oil in water by mixing them at a microscopic level
- Prove the Pythagorean theorem and identify its premises
- Lay out evidence that water, steam, and ice are the same substance despite having different properties
- Prices respond to market forces, rather than being arbitrary
- *Not understanding: Student knows the formula for Newton's 2nd law, but can't tell when it applies.*

### Analysis

To explain seemingly unconnected events, we use theories about the unseen, which requires some imagination. One who can do this can generate testable hypotheses. Evidence for this understanding requires the student to confront new facts or unfamiliar situations, respond by identifying relevant principles, and account for contradictions or paradoxes. Problem-based learning seems most appropriate for building this type of understanding.


## Interpretation

Interpretation generates meaning for events and observations through imagery and narrative. When a student engages in interpretation, they transform facts into a compelling narrative about something other than the facts or assumptions themselves, and answer questions like:

- What does this means?
- Why does it matter?

### Examples

- *Gulliver's Travels* is not just a fairy tale, but a satire of British political discourse.
- A collection of Depression-era stories is not just offering reflections, but also a parable about saving money.
- *Reading Genesis* brings out themes that endure through two millenia.
- *Reading Genesis* is an apology for patriarchy
- *Not undestanding: Student translates all the words in a sentence, but can't tell what the sentence means.*

### Analysis

For a given situation or form of expression, meaning can vary. Meaning is constructed, shaped by personal experience. An interpretation is subject to criticism within a cultural context and must be defended with reference to agreed-upon observations or measures.


## Application

Application produces a solution or response to an unresolved problem in beyond existing knowledge and experience. When a student engages in application, they analyze the situation and identify needed skills and knowledge relevant to it, and answer questions like:

- What theories and methods are relevant to this situation?
- What aspects of this problem have we seen before?
- Is the solution effective?

### Examples

- Use financial principles to construct a feasible savings plan.
- Use statistical methods to project the costs of a candy store.
- Judge that unsufficient data are available to explain a discrepancy.
- Given case materials, infer the cause of disease and recommend further tests to confirm.
- After writing a script, judge that it is ineffective despite conforming to expected production standards.

### Analysis

To solve problems, we match our ideas and knowledge to the relative aspects of a situation. Thus assessment in this dimension should be both novel and context-dependent. One feature of the problem-solving process is selecting a solution "path" that is consistent with external constraints of a problem. Learning efforts should be directed toward an artifact defined by articulated production or performance standards.


## Speculation

Speculation represents alternative accounts by assuming different premises and perspectives for a situation. When a student engages in speculation, they discriminate between different assumptions and approaches to explain conflicting conclusions, and answer questions like:

- Whose perspective is involved, and what aspects of their reality distinguish the perspective?
- What premises are hidden or unacknowledged?
- What aspects of the situation are most salient to this perspective?
- How are actions and signals construed from this perspective?

### Examples

- Recognize the intent behind an advertisement based on popularity and detect the implicit fallacy.
- Compare both Israeli and Palestinian interests in Gaza settlement policy.
- Make explicit the role of technophilic language in gender exclusion.
- Ask how motion of planets is consistent with Ptolemaic model.
- Wonder if an abortion ban would change the public's perception of Zika virus.
- Investigate why Black people find "All Lives Matter" offensive.
- *Not understanding: Apply canonical model to a phenomenon and refuse to assess alternative one.*

### Analysis

Perspective shifting takes focus and urgency away from a goal or outcome. It is not just a skill, but a habit of mind related to empathy. In its more sophisticated form, it involves investigating the vested interests of participants in a discourse, especially authorities. In instruction, it often requires one to turn attention to authors and intentions. It also suggests exposing students to alternative, non-canonical accounts.


## Empathy

Empathy urges one to accept other participants and voices into a discourse by seeking another's experiences. When a student engages in empathy, they overcome the instinct to dismiss ideas they are not attached to, and answer questions like:

- What experiences and feelings do I lack?
- What commitments drive another participant's contribution?

### Examples

- Young person expresses sorrow for challenges of a bedridden elder.
- Male imagines the thoughts and feelings compelling Juliet's drastic action.
- Policy maker predicts the emotional impact of decisions or actions.
- *Not undertanding: Prodigy athlete coach berates young players who don't pick up technique quickly.*

### Analysis

Empathy is the colloquial meaning of "understanding". It requires acceptance of another person's internal experience instead of analysis. In contrast to interpretation, we prioritize that person's view in light of their experiences. It is successful when it shatter's ego- and ethno-centrism, but in a disciplined, deliberative way.


## Metacognition

Metacognition identifies patterns of thought and their effect on one's own learning. When a student egnages in metacognition, they recognize their ignorance and acknowledge the change to their understanding, and answer questions like:

- How do I learn new things?
- What am I likely to miss because of how I think?

### Examples

- Recognize that frustration with a child may be rooted in own childhood experience. 
- Deliberately use a graphic organizer to overcome a weakness in learning. 

### Analysis

A pitfall of learning is the potential for confirmation bias and resistance to facts that challenge internal thinking. This tendency in turn impedes the development of nuanced interpretation. There is a tendency to interpret facts selectively and detect order where there is none, so metacognition reflects the ability to recognize and acknowledge this possibility.


# Unpacking standards

## Critique of standards

The authors present some examples of state standards, pointing out that they often contain too many discrete items, encompass too broad a scope, or are simply too general to be distinguished from learning overall.

Despite these failings, standards often contain the elements of UbD components, including key ideas, performance indicators, and sample tasks. Thus they hint at the type of evidence that might be sought in assessing learning. 

The authors therefore recommend unpacking these components. One strategy is to monitor recurring nouns, adjectives, and verbs to identify for broad, transferable ideas and specific performance expectations; and translate these into essential questions, core ideas, and performance tasks.

For geography:

> Analyze regional development of Asia, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, in terms of physical, economic, cultural characteristics, and historical evolution since 1000 C.E.

For social studies:

> 1. Compare present with past, evaluating consequences of past events and determining lessons learned.
> 2. Analyze how change happens at different rates over time; understand that some aspects can change while others do not.
> 3. Use a variety of maps and documents to interpret human movement, including settlement patterns, technological innovations, ...

For science:

> The purpose of science is to develop explanations of natural phenomena in a continuing creative process:
> - formulate questions, with aid of appropriate references, in searching to explain everyday observations
> - construct explanations for natural phenomena by proposing visual models
> - represent and defend explanations in a comprehensible way for assessment
>
> For example, when shown disparity between recyclable content and actual recycling, explain by developing possible theories and selecting one; refining it for further assessment; rated on clarity, plausibility, and suitability for research and further study.


## Mathematics example

As an example, the authors take a convoluted mathematical modeling standard from New Jersey:

> All students will connect mathematics to other learning by understanding the interrelationships of mathematical ideas and the roles that mathematics and mathematical modeling play in other disciplines and in life.

From the nouns and adjectives, they infer the big idea:

- mathematical modeling applies to various disciplines and life

From the verbs the infer some performance indicators:

- give examples of modeling applied to real-life data or phenomena
- review a mathematical model for appropriateness to a situation

They translate these insights to essential questions, core ideas, and performance tasks:

- What is the pattern in a phenomenon or situation?
- How do we know if a model is appropriate for a situation?

- Models help us to simply and analyze a situation in terms of a relationship.
- Models help to explain patterns.
- A model can mislead one's thinking, so we evaluate its appropriateness.

- Have students construct a mathematical model for a given problem, such as seasonal temperature data, that are consistent with multiple plausible relationships.
- Review a proposed model for appropriateness to a given situation, e.g. Mercator Projection for spatial information.


## Science example

To test my understanding of the process, I decided to apply it to the science example.

### Goal

> The purpose of science is to develop explanations of natural phenomena in a continuing creative process:
> - formulate questions, with aid of appropriate references, in searching to explain everyday observations
> - construct explanations for natural phenomena by proposing visual models
> - represent and defend explanations in a comprehensible way for assessment
>
> For example, when shown disparity between recyclable content and actual recycling, explain by developing possible theories and selecting one; refining it for further assessment; rated on clarity, plausibility, and suitability for research and further study.

**Nouns:** natural phenomena, explanations, creative process, questions, appropriate references, visual models, everyday explanations.

**Adjectives:** plausible, suitable, comprehensible, appropriate

**Verbs:** develop, formulate, explain, construct, proposing, represent, defend, refine

### Core ideas and essential questions

- scientific process produces explanations of observed, natural phenomena
- scientists generate and improve explanations through reasoned discourse

- What makes an explanation appropriate and plausible?
- How do we generate plausible explanations given observations?
- How do scientists respond to an implausible explanation?
- How do we taest whether an appropriate explanation is actually true?

### Performance indicators

- Formulate questions for testing an explanation
- Propose explanations that address observations
- Assess plausbility and relevance of a given explanation

Task: Given a country's recycling data, broken out by material type and recycling process, propose three possible theories to explain the discrepancy. Assess the plausibility of each one and select the best two. For each one, cite a possible reason it would not be correct, and describe the information needed to discriminate the two theories. Write instructions for searching for this information.


## Qualities of a big idea

The authors point out some attributes of "big ideas":

- broad application across subjects
- abstractions
- represented by just a few words
- timeless
- represented by examples with common attributes

They assert that such ideas provide a focusing lens for studying a particular topic, and provide the thread connecting detailed facts and skills. They can expose the difference between expert and novice abilities, often in the form of a common misunderstanding. They should transfer across subjects and over time.


## Provocative idea of UbD

UbD actively embraces a core idea that is so unintuitive to many people: that thorough, deep undestanding of a discipline's representative ideas *is equivalent to* knowing the entire discipline, because it promotes comprehension of patterns, speeds acquisition of other elements, and generates new knowledge for the discipline.


## Methods of generating big ideas

1. Identify abstract ideas in general educational standards and goals.
2. Identify recurring nouns and verbs in standards documents.
3. Refer and reuse common transferrable concepts, e.g., equilibrium, interactions, patterns, perspective.
4. Ask generative questions about a topic, e.g., What makes {...} universal? How is the concept of {...} used in practice?
5. Express distinctions, e.g. absorb vs reflect, continuity vs change, nation vs people, meaning vs syntax.

### Enliven core ideas with:

- potential misunderstandings
- paradoxes
- counterintuitive examples
- difficulty of proving something

### Link core ideas with skills

For example, 

- To persuade, a writer must understand persuasion itself and why some techniques are effective in some situations rather than others.
- To create an appropriate model, one must understand what makes it valid and applicable, and the potential ways models can mislead.

### Use common types of questions for stimulating inquiry

- Why study {{topic}}? Why does it matter?
- What makes studying {{topic}} universally relevant?
- What is the moral of the narrative about {{topic}}?
- What core idea is implied by the process of {{topic}}?
- What larger problems underly {{topic}}?
- What would happen if we didn't understand {{topic}}?
- How do others use and apply {{topic}}?

### Use suggestive pairs to generate ideas

- absorb and reflect
- action and reaction
- capital and labor
- constant and variable
- continuity and change
- factor and result
- fate and freedom
- light and shadow
- like and unlike
- literal and figurative
- matter and energy
- power and governance
- sign and signified
- structure and function
- sum and difference


### Look to common transferable concepts

For example, the NGSS defines "cross-cutting concepts" that students should encounter and recognize across disciplines and grade levels.

Within discourse on pedagogy, many transferable concepts have been identified, such as:

- competition for resources
- adaptation to change
- aging and maturity
- balance and tradeoffs
- change vs continuity
- community
- compassion
- conflict
- consistency
- cooperation
- correlation
- courage
- cycles
- defense vs exploration
- democracy
- dignity
- discovery and invention
- environment
- equilibrium
- evolution
- fairness
- friendship
- harmony
- honor and loyalty
- interactions
- interdependence
- justice and liberty
- migration
- mood
- order
- patterns
- perspective
- productivity
- quality vs quantity
- proof and refutation
- rhythm
- survival
- symbol
- system
- technology
- variability
