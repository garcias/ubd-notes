# Overview of Understanding by Design framework

UbD involves a structured planning process for developing curriculum and instruction. It emphasizes *understanding* as an outcome of instruction, and designing curriculum toward this end.

## Key ideas

1. Learning is enhnaced when teachers think about curricular planning in a deliberate, purposeful, articulated way.
2. The UbD framework focuses attention on deepening understanding and "transfer of learning" (application of knowledge and skill)
3. To reveal understanding to both student and instructor, the student transfers learning through authentic performance. 
4. Understanding can be indicated through six facets:
    - explaining
    - interpreting
    - applying
    - shifting perspective
    - empathizing
    - self assessing
5. Teachers define long-term objectives first and plan curriculum backward through the process of Outcomes, Evidence, Plan.
6. Teachers coach their students toward understanding, and assess progress in terms of meaning and transfer.
7. Reviewing curriculum against design standards provides topics for discussion of improvement.
8. UbD is guided by two major sources of evidence:
    - theoretical research in cognitive psychology
    - empirical studies of student achievement


## Backward design process 


### Identify desired outcomes

What transfer should occur, *i.e.* what should students know and be able to do? What understanding should they carry with them past the experience? What essential questions are explored through learning?

We identify important **content goals**, which often involves established content standards and external expectations. As a result, teachers make choices and prioritize specific content over others.

We also identify **performance expectations**: what should students be able to do with what they learned? We envision how they might use their learning in another setting, and what meaning they have made from the experience.

Transfer goals can take a variety of forms: making decision based on analysis, creating a document, making predictions based on pattern recognition, evaluating intellectual claims, or performing a work.

**Essential questions** help students deepend their understanding of the ideas and skills they acquire.

Examples of understandings:

- Literature explores universal themes of human existence; "How can stories from other times and places inform our current lives?"
- Literature can reveal truths through fiction; "What aspects of life can fiction reveal to the reader?"
- Quantitative data can be collected and organized in a variety of ways; "What is the most effective way to demonstrate the relationship?"
- A mathematial relationship can be represented numerically, graphically, or symbolically; "How else can this relationship be represented?"
- The geography of a region influences the culture and economy of its inhabitants; "How does where I live affect my behavior and perception?"
- Arts and culture are mutually influence each other; "How does art shape culture?"

UbD asserts that knowledge and skills are learned not for their own sake, but as a means to larger ends. Teachers play a part in determining these ends.


### Determine assessment evidence

How do we know we've achieved the desired outcome? What will stakeholders accept as evidence of understanding and transfer to new situations? How do we evaluate performance expectations in a fair and consistent way?

Teachers think like assessors before designing and implementing specific components. We need to anticipate what evidence will indicate that the desired outcomes have in fact been achieved, and in a form that can be documented. 

The most informative form of assessment is a performance task, which should ask students to apply learning to a novel, authentic situation. Indicators of understanding include the ability to:

- **explain** concepts and principles
- **interpret** data, observations, models, and artifacts
- **apply** knowledge and skills to novel contexts
- demonstrate **perspective** ___
- display **empathy** for other others
- **reflect** on the significance of the learning experience

Not all facets need be accessed in a performance task, and tasks need not form the basis of learning activities.

More recognizable forms of assessment, such as quizzes, observations, and work samples may complement assessment.

Regardless of type, each assessment should be **aligned** explicitly with one or more outcomes.
