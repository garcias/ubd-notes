# Overview of Understanding by Design framework

UbD involves a structured planning process for developing curriculum and instruction. It emphasizes *understanding* as an outcome of instruction, and designing curriculum toward this end.

## Key ideas

1. Learning is enhnaced when teachers think about curricular planning in a deliberate, purposeful, articulated way.
2. The UbD framework focuses attention on deepening understanding and "transfer of learning" (application of knowledge and skill)
3. To reveal understanding to both student and instructor, the student transfers learning through authentic performance. 
4. Understanding can be indicated through six facets:
    - explaining
    - interpreting
    - applying
    - shifting perspective
    - empathizing
    - self assessing
5. Teachers define long-term objectives first and plan curriculum backward through the process of Outcomes, Evidence, Plan.
6. Teachers coach their students toward understanding, and assess progress in terms of meaning and transfer.
7. Reviewing curriculum against design standards provides topics for discussion of improvement.
8. UbD is guided by two major sources of evidence:
    - theoretical research in cognitive psychology
    - empirical studies of student achievement


## Backward design process 


### Identify desired outcomes

What transfer should occur, *i.e.* what should students know and be able to do? What understanding should they carry with them past the experience? What essential questions are explored through learning?

We identify important **content goals**, which often involves established content standards and external expectations. As a result, teachers make choices and prioritize specific content over others. We expect students to Acquire (A) such knowledge.

We also identify **performance expectations**: what should students be able to do with what they learned? We envision how they might use their learning in another setting, and what meaning they have made from the experience. We expect students to Transfer (T) their learning to a new context.

Transfer goals can take a variety of forms: making decision based on analysis, creating a document, making predictions based on pattern recognition, evaluating intellectual claims, or performing a work.

**Essential questions** help students deepen their understanding of the ideas and skills they acquire. We expect students to create Meaning (M) from what they learn.

Examples of understandings:

- Literature explores universal themes of human existence; "How can stories from other times and places inform our current lives?"
- Literature can reveal truths through fiction; "What aspects of life can fiction reveal to the reader?"
- Quantitative data can be collected and organized in a variety of ways; "What is the most effective way to demonstrate the relationship?"
- A mathematial relationship can be represented numerically, graphically, or symbolically; "How else can this relationship be represented?"
- The geography of a region influences the culture and economy of its inhabitants; "How does where I live affect my behavior and perception?"
- Arts and culture are mutually influence each other; "How does art shape culture?"

UbD asserts that knowledge and skills are learned not for their own sake, but as a means to larger ends. Teachers play a part in determining these ends.


### Determine assessment evidence

How do we know we've achieved the desired outcome? What will stakeholders accept as evidence of understanding and transfer to new situations? How do we evaluate performance expectations in a fair and consistent way?

Teachers think like assessors before designing and implementing specific components. We need to anticipate what evidence will indicate that the desired outcomes have in fact been achieved, and in a form that can be documented. 

The most informative form of assessment is a performance task, which should ask students to apply learning to a novel, authentic situation. Indicators of understanding include the ability to:

- **explain** concepts and principles
- **interpret** data, observations, models, and artifacts
- **apply** knowledge and skills to novel contexts
- demonstrate **perspective** ___
- display **empathy** for other others
- **reflect** on the significance of the learning experience

Not all facets need be accessed in a performance task, and tasks need not form the basis of learning activities.

More recognizable forms of assessment, such as quizzes, observations, and work samples may complement assessment.

Regardless of type, each assessment should be **aligned** explicitly with one or more outcomes.

## Plan learning experiences

How do we support learners in understanding ideas and processes? What knowledge and skills will enable students to achieve the desired outcomes and meet performance expectations?
What tasks do they need to accomplish in order to transfer their learning?

Typically Acquiring Knowledge (**A**) is emphasized, while Creating Meaning (**M**) and Transferring Skills (**T**) are often neglected goals. In making plans, mark events and activities with **T**, **M**, **A** to remain aware of the balance among them.

Students have a better chance of understanding when they have numerous opportunities to draw inferences and construct knowledge autonomously. They have a better chance of transfer if they have many opportunities to apply learning to novel, authetic situations, and receive timely feedback. 

## FAQ

### Does this framework de-emphasize content knowledge and skill?

The framework challenges the designer to specify the knowledge and skills that are actually necessary for achieving the learning goals. This encourages greater awareness of the purpose of each content unit, and may lead an educator to assess its value and accordingly prioritize some content over others.

### Does the design process apply to individual lesson plans?

The process should be applied at the scale at which understanding is built, which is usually larger than a single lesson.

### Can the Facets of Understanding be mapped to Bloom's Taxonomy?

Bloom's Taxonomy supposes an inherent hierarchy to each type of learning objective, while the Facets are conceived of as orthogonal indicators of understanding.

### How is it possible to cover all six Facets in an assessment?

The Facets are not meant as a measure of an assessment's completeness. The designer should first consider what is *appropriate evidence* of understanding for a particular objective; and use the Facets as a toolbox for assembling an effective assessment.

[SG: In order to assess a diverse classroom and gain a comprehensive picture of understanding, a good assessment will most likely need to employ multiple Facets.] 

### Are textbooks important in implementing this framework?

They can be, in specific roles. A textbook can provide a recognized, uniform presentation of content knowledge. But a designer (for understanding) should not then accept all of the content as equally valuable without examination.


## UbD in a nutshell

- ### Stage 1: Desired Results
    - What long-term transfer goals are targeted?
    - What meanings should students make in order to arrive at important understandings?
    - What essential questions will students explore? What knowledge and skill will students acquire? What established goals/standards are targeted?
- ### Stage 2: Evidence
    - What performances and products will reveal evidence of meaning-making and transfer?
    - By what criteria will performance be assessed, in light of Stage 1 desired results?
    - What additional evidence will be collected for all Stage 1 desired results?
    - Are the assessments aligned to all Stage 1 elements?
- ### Stage 3: Learning Plan
    - What activities, experiences, and lessons will lead to achievement of the desired results and success at the assessments?
    - How will the learning plan help students with acquisition, meaning-making, and transfer?
    - How will the unit be sequenced and differentiated to optimize achievement for all learners?
    - How will progress be monitored?
    - Are the learning events in Stage 3 aligned with Stage 1 goals and Stage 2 assessments?

- ### The Seven Tenets of the UbD Framework
    - Learning is enhanced when teachers think purposefully about curricular planning.
    - The UbD framework helps to focus curriculum and teaching on the development and deepening of student understanding and transfer of learning.
    - Understanding is revealed when students autonomously make sense of and transfer their learning through authentic performance. 
    - Six capacities can serve as indicators of understanding: explain, interpret, apply, shift perspective, empathize, and self-assess.
    - Effective curriculum is planned backward from long-term, desired results through a three-stage design process (Desired Results, Evidence, and Learning Plan).
    - Teachers are coaches of understanding, by checking that the learner successfully makes meaning and transfers learning.
    - Regularly reviewing units and curriculum against design standards enhances curricular quality and effectiveness, and provides engaging and professional discussions.
    - The UbD framework supports continual improvement in curriculum and instruction.
