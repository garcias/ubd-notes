# Facets of understanding

Wiggins and McTighe describe six aspects of understanding in terms of how understanding is manifested in student behavior.

## Characteristic attributes

The facets seem to be distinguished by three attributes, which provide a rubric for organizing and comparing them: 

- locus of awareness: **personal** vs **impersonal**
- scope of attention: **goal-oriented** vs **context-oriented**
- scope of composition: **eliminative** vs **generative**

Four facets are *impersonal* in that the student's thinking is about things outside of their mind, and are probably the most identifiably academic. Of them, **Explanation** and **Application** are *goal-oriented*, where the outcome of thinking achieves a purpose. Explanation involves matching observations, events, and other evidence against a single explanatory account, often *eliminating* inconsistent hypotheses along the way. Application, in contrast, involves invoking theory in responding to constraints, to generate one or more possible solutions to a problem.

**Speculation** and **Interpretation** are *context-oriented*, where thinking is embedded in the context of a situation. Speculation involves perspective taking, trying to hypothesize how an actor's perspective affects the significance of a given event or fact; it is *eliminative* in the sense that it applies constraints based on what is known or expected. Interpretation, in contrast, involves *generating* alternative stories based on what is *not* known, and strives to expand notions of what is possible.

The other two facets are *personal* in that student's thinking is about their own mind and how it changes. **Empaty** involves acquiring the affective response of another person to a given situation, and fundamentally accepting other people (their minds, their experiences, their aims) into a discourse. **Metacognition** involves self awareness of current, established patterns of thought and their limits.


## Explanation

Explanation accounts for specific events, phenomena, and observations using generalized models, theories, and abstractions. When a student engages in explanation, they address the "why and how", and answer questions like:

- Why did an event happen?
- How can we prove a relationshion?
- What does our account imply?

### Examples

- Myriad cake recipes are based on a small set of formulas
- We infer the cause of a set of unexpected sounds and motions
- Mustard emulsifies oil in water by mixing them at a microscopic level
- Prove the Pythagorean theorem and identify its premises
- Lay out evidence that water, steam, and ice are the same substance despite having different properties
- Prices respond to market forces, rather than being arbitrary
- *Not understanding: Student knows the formula for Newton's 2nd law, but can't tell when it applies.*

### Analysis

To explain seemingly unconnected events, we use theories about the unseen, which requires some imagination. One who can do this can generate testable hypotheses. Evidence for this understanding requires the student to confront new facts or unfamiliar situations, respond by identifying relevant principles, and account for contradictions or paradoxes. Problem-based learning seems most appropriate for building this type of understanding.


## Interpretation

Interpretation generates meaning for events and observations through imagery and narrative. When a student engages in interpretation, they transform facts into a compelling narrative about something other than the facts or assumptions themselves, and answer questions like:

- What does this means?
- Why does it matter?

### Examples

- *Gulliver's Travels* is not just a fairy tale, but a satire of British political discourse.
- A collection of Depression-era stories is not just offering reflections, but also a parable about saving money.
- *Reading Genesis* brings out themes that endure through two millenia.
- *Reading Genesis* is an apology for patriarchy
- *Not undestanding: Student translates all the words in a sentence, but can't tell what the sentence means.*

### Analysis

For a given situation or form of expression, meaning can vary. Meaning is constructed, shaped by personal experience. An interpretation is subject to criticism within a cultural context and must be defended with reference to agreed-upon observations or measures.


## Application

Application produces a solution or response to an unresolved problem in beyond existing knowledge and experience. When a student engages in application, they analyze the situation and identify needed skills and knowledge relevant to it, and answer questions like:

- What theories and methods are relevant to this situation?
- What aspects of this problem have we seen before?
- Is the solution effective?

### Examples

- Use financial principles to construct a feasible savings plan.
- Use statistical methods to project the costs of a candy store.
- Judge that unsufficient data are available to explain a discrepancy.
- Given case materials, infer the cause of disease and recommend further tests to confirm.
- After writing a script, judge that it is ineffective despite conforming to expected production standards.

### Analysis

To solve problems, we match our ideas and knowledge to the relative aspects of a situation. Thus assessment in this dimension should be both novel and context-dependent. One feature of the problem-solving process is selecting a solution "path" that is consistent with external constraints of a problem. Learning efforts should be directed toward an artifact defined by articulated production or performance standards.


## Speculation

Speculation represents alternative accounts by assuming different premises and perspectives for a situation. When a student engages in speculation, they discriminate between different assumptions and approaches to explain conflicting conclusions, and answer questions like:

- Whose perspective is involved, and what aspects of their reality distinguish the perspective?
- What premises are hidden or unacknowledged?
- What aspects of the situation are most salient to this perspective?
- How are actions and signals construed from this perspective?

### Examples

- Recognize the intent behind an advertisement based on popularity and detect the implicit fallacy.
- Compare both Israeli and Palestinian interests in Gaza settlement policy.
- Make explicit the role of technophilic language in gender exclusion.
- Ask how motion of planets is consistent with Ptolemaic model.
- Wonder if an abortion ban would change the public's perception of Zika virus.
- Investigate why Black people find "All Lives Matter" offensive.
- *Not understanding: Apply canonical model to a phenomenon and refuse to assess alternative one.*

### Analysis

Perspective shifting takes focus and urgency away from a goal or outcome. It is not just a skill, but a habit of mind related to empathy. In its more sophisticated form, it involves investigating the vested interests of participants in a discourse, especially authorities. In instruction, it often requires one to turn attention to authors and intentions. It also suggests exposing students to alternative, non-canonical accounts.


## Empathy

Empathy urges one to accept other participants and voices into a discourse by seeking another's experiences. When a student engages in empathy, they overcome the instinct to dismiss ideas they are not attached to, and answer questions like:

- What experiences and feelings do I lack?
- What commitments drive another participant's contribution?

### Examples

- Young person expresses sorrow for challenges of a bedridden elder.
- Male imagines the thoughts and feelings compelling Juliet's drastic action.
- Policy maker predicts the emotional impact of decisions or actions.
- *Not undertanding: Prodigy athlete coach berates young players who don't pick up technique quickly.*

### Analysis

Empathy is the colloquial meaning of "understanding". It requires acceptance of another person's internal experience instead of analysis. In contrast to interpretation, we prioritize that person's view in light of their experiences. It is successful when it shatter's ego- and ethno-centrism, but in a disciplined, deliberative way.


## Metacognition

Metacognition identifies patterns of thought and their effect on one's own learning. When a student egnages in metacognition, they recognize their ignorance and acknowledge the change to their understanding, and answer questions like:

- How do I learn new things?
- What am I likely to miss because of how I think?

### Examples

- Recognize that frustration with a child may be rooted in own childhood experience. 
- Deliberately use a graphic organizer to overcome a weakness in learning. 

### Analysis

A pitfall of learning is the potential for confirmation bias and resistance to facts that challenge internal thinking. This tendency in turn impedes the development of nuanced interpretation. There is a tendency to interpret facts selectively and detect order where there is none, so metacognition reflects the ability to recognize and acknowledge this possibility.
