# Example: a unit on nutrition

## Established goals

> - (6) Students will understand essential concepts about **nutrition** and **diet**
>     - (6a) ... and use their understanding to **plan** appropriate diets for themselves ...
>     - (6b) ... and understand their own eating **patterns** and ways to **improve** them.

### Essential questions

- What defines healthful eating?
- How can you tell if someone's eating pattern is healthy?
- How can a diet be healthy for one person and not for another?
- Why does unhealthy eating persist despite plenty of established facts?

### Desired understandings

- A balanced diet affects physical and mental healthful.
- USDA guidelines are relative references for diet planning.
- Diet requirements vary according to age, activity level, and weight.
- Healthful eating requires you to act on nutritional information and possibly break comfortable habits.

### Knowledge

- Distinction between protein, fat, carbohydrates
- Types of food and nutrional values
- Variables that affect nutritional needs
- Health problems linked to poor nutrition

### Skills

- interpret nutrional information
- analyze nutrional value of a given diet
- plan balanced diet for a specific need (particularly diabetes, celiac)


## Acceptable Evidence

### Performance tasks

1. Create an [illustrated brochure][application] to [teach][explanation] children the [importance of good nutrition][interpretation] and [offer ideas][apply] for [breaking habits][perspective].

2. [Develop][application] a three-day menu for an Outdoor Education camp. Write a letter to the [camp director][perspective] to [advocate for the menu][explanation], accounting for their constraints ([USDA guidelines][interpretation] and [student enjoyment][perspective]). Include at least one [alternative][empathy] for a specific dietary concern (diabetes, vegetarian, celiac, religious).

### Other

- Quiz: on food groups and USDA guidelines
- Writing prompt: describe two health problems caused by poor nutrition and how to avoid them
- Skill check: interpret product labels to determine nutritional value.

### Self assessment

1. Assess your brochure
2. Assess your menu
3. Reflect on your own eating patterns and whether it si healthful

### Uncoverage and unobvious

1. Healthful, nutritious food must taste bad.
2. If it is popular and mainstream, it must be okay.
3. Vendors put health above profit.
4. Menu planning is only about food groups (rather than balancing cost, taste, culture, and personal needs)
