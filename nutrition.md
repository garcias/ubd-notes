# Example: a unit on nutrition

## Established goals

> - (6) Students will understand essential concepts about **nutrition** and **diet**
>     - (6a) ... and use their understanding to **plan** appropriate diets for themselves ...
>     - (6b) ... and understand their own eating **patterns** and ways to **improve** them.

### Essential questions

- What defines healthful eating?
- How can you tell if someone's eating pattern is healthy?
- How can a diet be healthy for one person and not for another?
- Why does unhealthy eating persist despite plenty of established facts?

### Desired understandings

- A balanced diet affects physical and mental healthful.
- USDA guidelines are relative references for diet planning.
- Diet requirements vary according to age, activity level, and weight.
- Healthful eating requires you to act on nutritional information and possibly break comfortable habits.

### Knowledge

- Distinction between protein, fat, carbohydrates
- Types of food and nutrional values
- Variables that affect nutritional needs
- Health problems linked to poor nutrition

### Skills

- interpret nutrional information
- analyze nutrional value of a given diet
- plan balanced diet for a specific need (particularly diabetes, celiac)


## Acceptable Evidence

### Performance tasks

1. Create an [illustrated brochure][application] to [teach][explanation] children the [importance of good nutrition][interpretation] and [offer ideas][apply] for [breaking habits][perspective].

2. [Develop][application] a three-day menu for an Outdoor Education camp. Write a letter to the [camp director][perspective] to [advocate for the menu][explanation], accounting for their constraints ([USDA guidelines][interpretation] and [student enjoyment][perspective]). Include at least one [alternative][empathy] for a specific dietary concern (diabetes, vegetarian, celiac, religious).

[perspective]: # "perspective"
[empathy]: # "empathy"
[metacognition]: # "metacognition"

### Other

- Quiz: on food groups and USDA guidelines
- Writing prompt: describe two health problems caused by poor nutrition and how to avoid them
- Skill check: interpret product labels to determine nutritional value.

### Self assessment

1. Assess your brochure
2. Assess your menu
3. Reflect on your own eating patterns and whether it si healthful

### Uncoverage and unobvious

1. Healthful, nutritious food must taste bad.
2. If it is popular and mainstream, it must be okay.
3. Vendors put health above profit.
4. Menu planning is only about food groups (rather than balancing cost, taste, culture, and personal needs)

## Learning plan

1. Begin with an entry question: "Can the food you eat cause acne?". Hook.
2. Introduce the the Essential Questions and discuss culminating performance tasks: the brochure and menu planning. Establish.
3. Students read and discuss selections from health textbook, keep a chart of their daily eating and drinking for later; introduce key vocabulary terms throughout. Equip, Explore.
4. Present concept attainment lesson on food groups and have students practice categorizing pictures of food according to these groups. Equip.
5. Introduce food pyramid; students work in teams to develop poster with cut-out pictures of food; display posters in hallway. Equip, Explore.
6. Give matching quiz on food groups and food pyramid. Evaluate.
7. Review and discuss USDA nutrition brochure with question: "Must everyone follow the same diet to be healthy?". Revise.
8. In teams students analyze hypothetical family's (unbalanced) diet and recommend improvements; observe and coach students as they work. Evaluate.
9. Teams share their analyses and discuss as a class; collect analyses and look for misunderstandings. Evaluate, Explore, Equip.
10. Each student designs an illustrated nutrition brochure to teach children about the importance of good nutrition for healthy living, and problems associated with poor eating (outside of class). Explore, Adapt.
11. Students share brochures for peer assessment based on criteria list; students make revisions in response to feedback. Revise, Evaluate.
12. Show video "Nutrition and You"; discuss health problems linked to poor eating. Explore.
13. Students listen and question a guest speaker (hospital nutritionist) about health problems. Explore.
14. Students write response papers: Describe two health problems that could arise from poor nutrition and explain what changes in eating could help avoid them; collect and check for misunderstandings. Evaluate.
15. Walk students through process on reading and interpreting food label information for nutritional information; students practice with donated food packages. Explore, Equip.
16. Students work individually to develop three-day camp menu; collect and give feedback; students assess projects using rubrics. Evaluate, Adapt.
17. Students review their daily eating chart and self assess healthfulness of diet: changes, improvements, feelings?. Evaluate, Reflect.
18. Students develop personal "eating action plan" to improve their health; collect and present at student-led parent conferences. Evaluate, Adapt.
