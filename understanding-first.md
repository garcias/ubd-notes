# Put understanding first

Wiggins and McTighe sum up the goals of instruction three fold:

> (1) acquire important information and skills, (2) make meaning of that content, and (3) transfer their learning to new situations.

As an example, they cite the ineffectiveness of memorizing the *Federalist Papers*. Knowing that text is not meaningful if the learner can't answer some important questions:

> - Why do we need checks on power? 
> - What problems is a three-branch system of government meant to address? 
> - When is the balance of power threatened? 
> - Where should I stand on the current debates about presidential power?

If a student explores the mechanisms for checking government powers, and case studies that explore the application and success of such checks, they will be able to answer these questions more generally later life.

The authors indict the practice of having students learn basic content out of the context in which that content is meaningful. They insist that learning skills is more effective when they are applied in response to the authentic demands of full problems.

## Instructional approaches

The authors identify three instructional approaches that support the goals of transfer, meaning, and acquisition, described by Mortimer Adler in *The Paideia Program*.

- Direct instruction
    - lecture
    - presentation
    - convergent questioning
    - demonstration
    - modeling
    - practice
    - feedback
- Facilitation
    - building analogies
    - organizing concepts
    - divergent questioning
    - simulation
    - problem-based learning
    - reciprocal teaching
    - self assessment
- Coaching
    - conferencing
    - reflection
    - commentary and feedback

## Sequencing

The authors are critical of schools and textbooks that stress knowledge acquisition to the exclusion of transfer and meaning. They call this a "climb-the-ladder" approach, though I think a more expressive term might be "bottom-heavy". They cite cognitive research challenging this approach, as well as our intutive observations on how people learn sports, arts, or language.

The bottom-heavy approach may actually be counterproductive, because the typical activities (memorization, drills, lecture) creates an isolating experience and shuts down motivation. These activities also reduce opportunities for learning in context.

As a contrast, the authors describe a possible unit on data analysis and measures of central tendency. It develops learning iteratively, with transfer, meaning, and acquisition occuring in response to each other. It finishes with a relevant transfer task and reflection on essential questions.

1. **Hook.** Give students a set of performance data and ask them to determine which group performs better and defend this conclusion. Prompt the class to generate alternative answers.
2. **Essential questions.** Present differnet situations in which the concept of fairness is relevant, and ask how fair should be defined and how unfairness should be detected.
3. **Preview performance standard.** Ask students to decide which measure of central tendency should be used to maximize one's grade. 
4. **Direct instruction.** Present examples of central tendency and practice calculating them and distinguishing them.
5. **Divergent questioning.** Ask students to generate situations in which a each measure is "better", and when a particular measure might be considered misleading.
6. **Apply to a task.** Have students simulate the "hook" problem and use measures of central tendency to illustrate the potential for uncertainty; and share their work with each other.
7. **Discussion.** Pose next-step questions about related aspects (effect of range and covariance), policy implications (consistency vs trend), special cases (how to deal with zeroes).
8. **Revisit hook.** Ask students to reevaluate the problem and their solutions to it.
9. **Final performance.** Ask students to decide which measure of central tendency should be used to maximize one's grade. 
10. **Reflect.** Instruct students to respond to the unit's essential questions and share these responses with teams.


## Assessment

The authors assert that assessment instruments be subjected to some simple scrutiny. Does an instrument address acquisition, meaning, and transfer? Is there a severe imbalance in them? Do they ask students to make inferences, analyze material, build arguments, or apply to new situations?

They further suggest that a well-designed and implemented course will publish its goals and performance standards in its syllabus.


## Conclusion

The authors' overall message can be abstracted in a simple comparison: (a) Avoid acquiring content for its own sake. (b) Instead, seek and apply this content in a context where it is meaningful and supported by essential questions.


## Addendum

### Example of essential questions

- What is fair? 
- How might mathematics help determine what is fair and unfair? 
- What do we mean when we say that the rules of a game of chance are not fair? 
- When is straight majority voting fair, and when is it not fair? 
- Is it fair to factor in degree of difficulty in diving competitions? 
- How about weighted grades in school? 


### Full text of the unit example

> - Begin with a hook problem. Give students a set of data—the finish times for 122 students in four 7th grade classes in a one-mile race held on field day. Ask students to work in small groups to determine which class won the race and prepare to convince other groups of their conclusion. Have each group present its solution and explanation to the class. Ask prompting questions to stimulate alternative answers and to elicit mathematical reasoning.
> - Introduce essential questions. What is fair? How might mathematics help determine what is fair and unfair? Present various situations to provoke a discussion about fairness, such as, What do we mean when we say that the rules of a game of chance are not fair? When is straight majority voting fair, and when is it not fair? Is it fair to factor in degree of difficulty in diving competitions? How about weighted grades in school? Ask students to draw some tentative conclusions to explore and test later in the unit.
> - Preview the culminating performance task. Tell students, "You will be asked to decide which measure of central tendency—mean, median, or mode—should be used to calculate your final quarterly grade in mathematics. You must explain which method you prefer and show your mathematical reasoning." The task will spark questions from students, such as, What is a median? … a mode?
> - Provide direct instruction on measures of central tendency linked back to the initial problem and essential questions. Give real-world examples. Students will be more likely to see the value of this information given the earlier activities and forthcoming performance task.
> - Provide practice on the basics. Have students do problems from the textbook to practice calculating mean, median, and mode. Give quizzes to check for conceptual understanding and computational accuracy.
> - Provide opportunities for further discussion. Have students engage in whole-class and small-group discussions of additional examples—for example, When is it most useful to know the "average" in various circumstances (salaries, home prices, batting average, price of a new car)? When is it misleading? What other information does an individual need to act wisely (for instance, to decide whether he or she can afford to buy a new car)?
> - Provide an application task. Help students think about the questions, When should we use mean, median, or mode? Where should we be careful in using each measure? Have each student construct a problem like the initial hook problem—a set of data that yields an uncertain solution to the question asked. Have students calculate the answer using all three modes of central tendency, choose the answer they think is best, and write a defense of that answer. In pairs, have students share questions and answers, try to solve each other's problem, and offer feedback to each other on the quality of their solutions and explanations.
> - Lead a whole-class discussion. Have students discuss related questions—for example, How important are range (variation) and trend when reaching a solution? Should you be rewarded or penalized for consistency or inconsistency or for downward or upward trend? Have students investigate several situations and draw conclusions (national sports team ranking systems, scores in diving competitions, stock market performance, and so on).
> - Provide a small-group application. Ask students to propose the fairest method for assigning quarterly grades. Should all grades be averaged? Should zeroes be factored in? Have each group present its proposal and explain its thinking to the class.
> - Revisit the original unit hook problem. Ask students, "Now which class do you think won the one-mile race?" Ask them to use what they have learned to reevaluate the problem and their solutions to it.
> - Assign the final performance task. Have students individually review their scores and grades for the quarter on quizzes, tests, homework, class work, their math journal, and so on to determine which measure of central tendency will yield the fairest grade for them. Have them write a note to you explaining their preferred method for grade calculation.
> - Give students opportunities to reflect on the unit's essential questions in their math journal and in paired and wholeclass discussions.
