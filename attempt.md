# Attempts at instructional designs

## General chemistry laboratory

### Big ideas

- Validating measurement
- Corroborating evidence
- Structural diversity in materials
- Limits of knowledge
- Discriminating false positives

### Essential questions

- How can you be sure that someone is implementing a complex procedure correctly?
    - What does "correctly" even mean?
    - Who gets to define "correct" or "standard"?
- How can we correct for inherent sources of error?
- How can experimental data and results lead us astray?

### Misunderstandings

- Experimental error refers to human incompetence, or a mistake made in procedure.
- Correct lab technique is following the instructions exactly.
- Experiments directly test fundamental laws and theories.


### Performance tasks

- Given a purportedly pure compound, design an experiment to test its authenticity and write a case study and procedure for high-school students to learn from it.
- Write a protocol to ensure reproducibility and an opportunity to validate a local implementation.
