# Action verbs used in teaching and learning

*Based primarily on list published by Center for Teaching and Learning at UNC Charlotte, http://teaching.uncc.edu/learning-resources/articles-books/best-practice/goals-objectives/action-verbs, reorganized by verb.*

Using behavioral verbs in our course and assessment activities has a number of benefits for engaging students in the learning process. First, because they describe an observable product or action, we can use them to devise activities that make the student an active participant in his or her learning. Secondly they may be used to help to translate our course goals and objectives into situations that are more concrete to the student and others. Their use also facilitates assessment because it allows us to make inferences about student learning through observable student behavior or products. The first section includes general definitions that describe only the observable behavior and do not include linkages to any specific content. Examples in selected discipline areas (science, math, social sciences) are provided at the end of the handout.


## Apply a rule

 To state a rule as it applies to a situation, object or event that is being analyzed. The statement must convey analysis of a problem situation and/or its solution, together with the name or statement of the rule that was applied.

-  The student could be asked to explain why a shotgun "kicks" when fired. His response would include a statement to the effect that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (Newton's Law of Motion), and that the "kick" of the shotgun is equal to the force propelling the shot toward its target. The faster the shot travels and the greater the weight of the shot, the greater the "kick" of the gun.
-  Given a pair of equations such as 2 + 4 + 7 = 13, and 7 + 2 + 4 = {{ }}, the student could be asked to apply a rule that would give him the solution to the second equation of the pair without adding the factors. His response should include a statement to the effect that the same numbers are to be added in each equation, but in different order (analysis) and that the order of addition makes no difference in the solution of the equations. Therefore, the sum of both equations is the same.
-  Given population data that illustrates the principle that the standard of living decreases if population increases without corresponding increase in production, the student could be asked to analyze the data to tell and tell how he is able to determine what effects changing population will have upon the standard of living.


## Classify

 To place objects, words, or situations into categories according to defined criteria for each category. The criteria must be made known to the student.

-  Given several examples of each, the student could be asked to classify materials according to their physical properties as gas, liquid, or solid.

## Define

 To stipulate the requirements for inclusion of an object, word, or situation in a category or class. Elements of one or both of the following must be included: (1) the characteristics of the words, objects, or situations that are included in the class or category, (2) the characteristics of the words, objects, or situations that are excluded in the class or category. To define is to set up criteria for classification.

-  Given several types of plant leaves, the student could be asked to define at least three categories for classifying them. NOTE: Defining is not memorizing and writing definitions created by someone else -- it is creating definitions.
-  Given an assortment of various kinds of coins, the student could be asked to define some categories into which the coins could be classified. His response would include definitions such as, "All of the pennies, all of the nickels, all of the dimes, etc., could be put in separate piles. Or all the coins containing silver could be put in one pile and those that don't into another pile."
-  Given a filmed or taped situation in which several forms of communication are portrayed, the student could be asked to define several categories of communication. His response could include definitions for verbal, non-verbal, pictorial, visual, auditory, or any of several other classes or categories of communication.

## Demonstrate

 The student performs the operations necessary for the application of an instrument, model, device, or implement. NOTE: There is a temptation to use demonstrate in objectives such as, "the student will demonstrate his knowledge of vowel sounds." As the verb is defined, this is improper use of it.

-  Given a model of the earth, sun, and moon so devised that it may be manipulated to show the orbits of the earth and moon, the student could be asked to demonstrate the cause of various phases of the moon as viewed from earth.
-  Given a sufficient number of concrete objects and an equation such as 3 x 4 = 12, the student could be asked to use the objects to demonstrate that multiplication is repeated addition. His response would include placement of twelve objects in three groups of four each, or four groups of three each. He may also be asked to describe how the demonstrations show repeated addition.

## Describe

 TO name all of the necessary categories of objects, object properties, or event properties that are relevant to the description of a designated situation. The objective is of the form, "The student will describe this order, object, or event," and does not limit the categories that may be used in mentioning them. Specific or categorical limitations, if any, are to be given in the performance standards of each objective.

-  The student could be asked to describe the conditions essential for a balanced aquarium that includes four goldfish.
-  The student could be asked to describe a method of determining a number of groups of five objects in a collection of 45 objects.

## Diagram

 To construct a drawing with labels and with a specified organization or structure to demonstrate knowledge of that organization or structure. Graphic charting and mapping are types of diagramming, and these terms maybe used where more exact communication of the structure of the situation and response is desired.

-  Given a bar graph that shows production of steel in the U.S. during the last fifty years, the student could be asked to interpret the graph. His response could include references to times of production increases or decreases, total amount of decreases or increases, and differences in production between the years.

## Locate

 To stipulate the position of an object, place, or event in relation to other specified objects, places, or events. Ideational guides to location such as grids, order arrangements and time may be used to describe location. Note: Locate is not to be confused with IDENTIFY.

-  The student could be asked to locate the position of chlorine on the periodic table. NOTE: To locate is to describe location. It is not identification of location.
