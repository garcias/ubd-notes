# Assessment evidence

## Characteristics of an authentic performance tasks

- Realistic setting with noice and ambiguity
- Identifies a realistic audience
- Specifies a purpose salient to the audience
- Allows for personalization
- Does not restrict access to resources and evaluative criteria
- Requires judgment and generation of possible solutions


## Authentic performance task attributes

**Frame.**      Problem statement is clear, but offers no clues to relevant principles or skills.

**Approach.**   Strategy is required, but multiple are possible and the appropriate ones are not obvious.

**Setting.**    Noisy with multiple factors, constraints, and data to consider

**Solution.**   Requires support and argument to be believed.

**Evidence.**   Plausibility and justification of approach matter.


## Method for generating authentic tasks

To generate an authentic performance task, address the *GRASPS* aspects of a task.

- **Goal:** task, problem, or obstacles
- **Role:** job, request, contract
- **Audience:** clients, stakeholders, supervisors
- **Situation:** context, constraints, backstory, challenge
- **Product:** create, develop
- **Standards:** criteria for success, benchmarks, outcomes

## Examples of performance tasks

### Visit to Virginia 

A group of nine exchange students is visiting school for a month. (They are fluent in English.) The principal would like your class to plan and budget a four-day tour of Virginia to help the visitors understand the state's impact on the history and development of our nation. Plan your tour so they see sites that best capture the ways that Virginia has influenced nation's development. Include a written tour itinerary tht explains why each site was selected, and include a map tracing the route for the four-day tour. Submit a budget for the trip that includes the nine students, two student guides, and three chaperones.

### Garden design

You work in the public relations office of a company whose logo has side-by-side circular, rectangular, and triangular shapes. You've been asked to contract a landscaping firm to create a garden piece that represents the logo, and you need to submit a design. Executive management needs to be able to envision it for approval, and an estimate of how much it will cost. The firm needs to know how to construct the design and what plants you want in each area.

### Literary Hall of Fame

The Council of Arts and Letters has announced a Hall of Fame to honor the works of notable U.S. authors and artists. Submit a nomination for an author to be admitted to the Hall of Fame. Nominations must include a 500–1000-word essay supporting the author's inclusion, including the author's contribution to U.S. literature as a whole.

### Moving Van Go

You work for a moving company that operates teams of 3 workers, overseen by a team manager, on each job. A local law firm is moving to a new location in a town 30 miles away, and has asked for bids from various moving companies (including yours). Your team's supervisor is on medical leave and you've been given the opportunity to take their place on this job. 

The most difficult task is to determine the minimum volume of furniture and equipment that can be moved, so the company can estimate the number of truck loads needed. The company typically tries to minimize the number of items that need to be carried from the site to the truck. Your analysis should account for the stackability of items, interlocking of noncubical pieces, padding on all contact surfaces, and the boes needed to pack small (padded) items. You are expected to submit organized documentation showing how you estimated each volume, and chart showing you can account for all items in the W x H x D volume of a truck.

### Drywalling a home

A leak severely damaged the south and west walls of one room in a home. A drywall company has submitted an estimate of the cost to replace both walls. Overcharging uninformed customers is common in this industry, but unfairly accusing a company of this practice will greatly damage business relations between the school and local businesses. Another more subtle problem is undercharging, which suggests that inappropriate materials or untrained labor may be employed. Estimate what you think is a reasonable cost range for this job.

### History of local conflict with Cheyenne Indians

Historical writings suggest a possible massacre of Cheyenne Indians during the Civil War in { _ }. No detailed narratives or reviews have been written about this particular incident, but there are conflicting first-hand accounts and transcripts of Senate business that touch on it. Department faculty and history majors are producing a collection of narratives about local history seen from different perspectives. Piece together your own narrative of what happened for inclusion in this collection. The editors will require a letter, less than 800 words, supporting the scholarly quality and significance of your work.


## Sundry ideas for assessment

### Grading

- volunteer for roles
- revise your work
- discuss progress
- promote, support, or facilitate collaborative activities
- provide value to a community
- have contribution to a project accepted
- demonstrate knowledge
- total mastery 
- progress goals over time
- exams
- quizzes

### Metacognition

Write a letter to your next teacher, addressing:

- what you did and your unique contribution to the class
- what you learned about your strengths and needs for learning
- how you succeeded and what presented challenges
- essential questions raised from this experience
- new learning goals for the next experience
- most important ideas and skills you are taking to the next class

### Empathy

At the end of any presentation, require the representative of the team to identify specific contributions of each team member toward their goal. Provide a vocabulary of possible terms (e.g., led discussion, generated questions, researched questions, analyzed data).

At the end of team discussion, have each team member identify the specific contributions of each team member; then compare with each other and document 

### 1-minute piece

At the end of each class, have students write for one minute:

- the main discovery or insight of the activity, that was new *to them*.
- a major unresolved question that remains, or was raised

### Discussion preparation

Require students to bring a discussion preparation to each class meeting. At the beginning:

- discuss questions with teammates, and prioritize them
- share with a class
- look for patterns among the shared questions


# Performance standards

## Criteria associated with understanding

### Explanation

A *sophisticated* explanation:

- articulates relevant points of a theory or model
- addresses multiple aspects of an issue
- accounts for multiple observations or concerns
- cites multiple lines of evidence per assertion
- applies principles consistently
- reveals relevance of seemingly unconnected ideas
- follows through on implications of account
- represents premises accurately
- expresses inferences and predictions logically

A *naive* explanation:

- speculates without follow-up
- makes sweeping generalizations
- generates multiple speculations per observation
- addresses concerns superficially
- fails to recognize underlying assumptions

### Application

A *masterful* application:

- adapts methods and principles to situation
- employs models consistently
- considers multiple possible options and judges which are relevant
- predicts and navigates the implications of proposed options
- identifies possible tools and resources readily
- identifies and uses a strategy to make choices more efficiently
- recognizes and applies constraints
- seeks out and marshalls relevant resources

A *novice* application:

- requires coaching
- applies methods in the wrong order
- applies methods to the wrong aspects of the situation
- applies irrelevant principles to situation
- relies on facile rules or templates
- ignores resources associated with subject

### Interpretation

An *insightful* interpretation:

- translates observations or artifact to meaning
- "reads between the lines" beyond surface value
- reveals hidden meaning and relevance
- produces a narrative
- makes plausible suggestions
- distinguishes significant elements from incidental ones
- cites evidence to support suggestions
- illustrates context

A *literal* interpretation:

- relies on facile rules to translate or decode elements
- overlooks wider significance of artifact
- paraphrases elements without adding context

### Perspective

A *coherent* perspective:

- encompasses mutiple points of view
- considers multiple elements of each perspective
- compares specific elements of different perspectives
- identifies or predicts implications of difference
- identifies specific strengths and weaknesses
- recognizes specific challenges of a perspective
- traces differences to specific premises and context
- expresses conflicting arguments fairly and neutrally
- reveals broader ideas through comparison of perspectives

An *uncritical* perspective:

- overlooks alternative points of view
- relies on ad hominem criticism
- essentializes differences

### Empathy

A *mature sensitive* performance:

- anticipates the responses of others to an action or idea
- accepts unfamiliar insights or methods
- seeks other perspectives
- seeks participation by collaborators
- responds to externally located concerns
- shuts up occasionally
- acknowledges specific contributions of others

An *egocentric* performance:

- lacks awareness of collaborative efforts and contributions
- dismisses alternative perspectives
- prioritizes accuracy exclusively

### Metacognition

A *reflective* performance:

- recognizes limits to knowledge
- considers and acknowledges potential personal bias
- considers personal assumptions
- identifies specific knowledge to be acquired
- generates questions to guide further inquiry
- separates personal beliefs and inferences from those of others
- predicts effect of personal projections


### Overall themes
