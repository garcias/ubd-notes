# Summary of research underlying UbD


Research explores differences between novice and expert in various fields. Experts have "well-organized knowledge of concepts and methods of inquiry". (Bransford, Brown, Cocking, 2000, p. 8).

TIMSS does more than rank student math achievement from different countries; it also studies their curricula and teaching practices. 

- In the U.S., mathematics and science curricula include many topics that are unfocused, while high-achieveing countries offer more coherent, developmental curricula. (Schmidt, Housing, Cogan, 2002; Schmidt 2004; Schmidt, McKnight, Raizen, 1997)
- Comparing mathematics instruction among Japan, Germany, U.S., revealed differences in teachers' goals. In Japan, teachers were likely to express their primary goal as being development of conceptual understanding, rather than acquisition of discrete skills. (Stigler, Hiebert, 1999; Hiebert, Gallimore, Garnier, 2003; Stigler, Hiebert, 2004)
- A review 300 lessons in U.S. K-12 classrooms found that successful lessons tended to emphasize students applying content to new situations.
- A 1996 study of high schools defined high-level pedagogy in terms of understanding (Newmann, 1996), and found that high-level pedagogy correlated with higher achievement levels and reduced achievement gaps. (Newman, Secada, Wehlage, 1995)
    - explore connections and relationships
    - organize, interpret, or explain complex information
    - reflect and elaborate on understanding
    - make connections outside of class


## Achievement studies in Chicago public schools

Smith, Lee, and Newmann (2001) conducted a study of elementary schools to link forms of instruction with test scores. They defined "interactive teaching methods" as teachers creating "situations in which students ask questions, develop strategies for solving problems, and communicate with each other" as they explain their answers and methods of solution. In addition, interactive teachers assess student mastery through discussions, projects, or exams that demand extended writing. Assignments are extended and may take several days to complete, and usually involve applications or interpretations of concepts. They found that students taught with interactive methods tend to have higher levels of learning and achievement (as judged by test scores?).

Newmann, Bryk, and Nagaoka (2001) conducted a similar study comparing classroom assignments with test performance. They rated assignments according to the degree of "authenticity", described as involving: original application of knowledge and skills, along with disciplined inquiry into the details of a problem and method of solution. Three key features are:

- construction of knowledge
- disciplined inquiry
- production of discourse, products, or performances with value beyond their didactic use

The authors concluded that students who receive this work achieve greater gains on standardized tests.


## High schools that work

Bottoms, Presson, and Johnson (1992) developed the *High Schools that Work (HSTW)* program, which is based on four principles:

- challenging curriculum that encourages students to use content and processes to complete (authetic) tasks
- teaching for understanding, which creates situations that challenge students to solve problems and create products
- teaching in context to apply academic learning to real problems - clear performance standards that demand students to demonstrate understanding

A study of this program found that students engaged in HSTW curriculum are more likely to achieve the HSTW achievement goals.
